# jSnakes: 3rd Street Project
	Simple multiplayer snake game written in vanilla JS.
	By default, there's just two player, but by it can expand,
	 to have more players (by specifying the corresponding input keys on the keyboard).

# Rules:
	It's all the rules of the old snake game except for:
	* Each snake just loses when colliding with the other one.
		So it doesnt lose when colling with its own segments.
	* Game doesnt end and its a challeng of record (PPT), of some sort.
	* When one snake loses, it just resets to its starting conditions (
		one segment, and 0 PPT), the other snake(s) continue to gather food,
		In this case, the game doesnt end.

# Input:
	[keyboard key => move]:
	First Player: w => up, s => down, d => right, a => left
	Second Player: 8 => up, 5 => down, 6 => right, 4 => left
# P.S.:
	This is the third project on the streets, of sorts :))
